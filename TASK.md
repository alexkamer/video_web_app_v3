# Video Learning Web App v3 - Development Tasks

This document outlines tasks that need to be addressed in the video learning web app, organized by priority level. Tasks were identified through a comprehensive code review.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Priority

- [ ] **[SECURITY]** Fix potential command injection vulnerability in download API endpoint (`pages/api/youtube/download/[id].js:137-158`) by implementing strict validation for videoId parameter
- [ ] **[SECURITY]** Patch XSS vulnerability in custom filename handling for downloads (`components/DownloadModal.js:213-214, 249-251`) by implementing proper filename sanitization
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Fix potential infinite loop in levenshteinDistance function (`components/TranscriptViewer.js:163-187`) by adding maximum string length checks
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Add memory management safeguards for large transcripts processing in Python summarization code (`scripts/summarize_transcript.py:311-336`)

## ðŸŸ  High Priority

- [ ] **[SECURITY]** Implement proper input sanitization and validation for YouTube video IDs across all API endpoints
- [ ] **[SECURITY]** Fix iframe security vulnerability in handleSegmentClick function (`components/TranscriptViewer.js:500-516`) by applying minimum necessary permissions
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Fix race condition in YouTube player initialization (`components/YouTubePlayer.js:225-229`) by implementing proper API readiness check
- [ ] **[BUG]** Fix memory leak in window event listeners for YouTube message handling (`components/TranscriptViewer.js:283, 322-324`)
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Implement pagination or windowing in transcript processing to prevent excessive memory usage (`components/TranscriptViewer.js:23-112`)
- [ ] **[REFACTOR]** Create a centralized YouTube API service to eliminate duplicate code for player initialization and control
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Implement proper cleanup mechanism for temporary files in download API (`pages/api/youtube/download/[id].js:270-282`)
- [ ] **[SECURITY]** Add timeout handling in Python process spawn for AI summarization (`utils/aiSummarizer.js:60-111`)
- [ ] **[BUG]** Fix race condition in async implementation of transcript summarization (`scripts/summarize_transcript.py:302-337`)
- [ ] **[BUG]** Fix potential deadlock in async processing of transcript chunks (`scripts/summarize_transcript.py:332`)

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority

- [ ] **[REFACTOR]** Split large components (TranscriptViewer.js, DownloadModal.js) into smaller, focused components
- [ ] **[TESTING]** Implement basic unit tests for critical components and API endpoints
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Extract complex transcript processing logic into a Web Worker to avoid blocking the main thread
- [ ] **[SECURITY]** Improve error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in API error responses (`pages/api/youtube/download/[id].js:317-321`)
- [ ] **[REFACTOR]** Create custom React hooks for common patterns like player control and transcript synchronization
- [ ] **[BUG]** Fix memory leak in fallback iframe creation for YouTube player (`components/YouTubePlayer.js:95-98, 102-127`)
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Optimize format selection logic in download component to reduce complexity (`pages/api/youtube/download/[id].js:26-120`)
- [ ] **[SECURITY]** Implement content-type validation for downloaded files (`pages/api/youtube/download/[id].js:236-245`)
- [ ] **[ARCHITECTURE]** Implement global state management (Context API or Redux) to avoid prop drilling
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Add streaming or chunking for large file downloads with progress reporting
- [ ] **[BUG]** Fix inconsistent environment variable handling in Python scripts (`scripts/summarize_transcript.py:23-37`)

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority

- [ ] **[CODE QUALITY]** Remove debugging console logs throughout codebase before production deployment
- [ ] **[CODE QUALITY]** Standardize error handling and logging approaches across components
- [ ] **[REFACTOR]** Implement TypeScript for improved type safety and development experience
- [ ] **[DOCUMENTATION]** Add JSDoc comments to all public functions and components
- [ ] **[TESTING]** Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Implement React.memo for pure components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] **[UI]** Improve error states and loading indicators for better user experience
- [ ] **[ARCHITECTURE]** Consider migrating to Next.js App Router with React Server Components
- [ ] **[CODE QUALITY]** Address prop drilling through React Context or custom hooks
- [ ] **[BUG]** Fix browser compatibility issues in custom seekTo implementation (`components/YouTubePlayer.js:142-169`)
- [ ] **[PERFORMANCE]** Optimize file stream error handling to prevent file descriptor leaks (`pages/api/youtube/download/[id].js:265-267`)
- [ ] **[CODE QUALITY]** Improve Python error handling and exception details (`scripts/summarize_transcript.py:153-155`)

## Areas for Future Improvement

- **Component Structure**: Refactor large components into smaller, more focused ones
- **State Management**: Implement a proper global state management solution
- **Testing Strategy**: Develop comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E testing
- **TypeScript Migration**: Convert the codebase to TypeScript for better type safety
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and better caching
- **API Abstraction**: Create service layers to decouple from external APIs
- **Documentation**: Improve inline documentation and add developer guides

## Getting Started

1. Prioritize addressing the Critical and High priority items first
2. Fix security vulnerabilities before performance optimizations
3. When refactoring components, ensure proper test coverage
4. Document changes made to complex algorithms or architecture
