# Video Quiz Debugging Report

## Summary of Investigation

We have added comprehensive debugging output to the VideoQuiz component to help understand why questions might not be appearing when skipping through videos. Additionally, we created a test script that simulates video playback and validates the question display mechanism.

## Key Findings

1. **Question Eligibility Logic Works Correctly**
   - Questions correctly appear when the video time reaches or exceeds their timestamp
   - Questions that have been answered are correctly filtered out
   - Questions with timestamps that have already been processed are correctly filtered out

2. **Skipping Behavior Validated**
   - When skipping past multiple timestamps, the component correctly identifies all eligible questions
   - The component shows the earliest question first (lowest timestamp) and marks it as processed
   - Subsequent questions at earlier timestamps get shown after answering the current question

3. **Missed Questions Tracking**
   - The component now tracks "missed questions" (questions whose timestamps have been passed but haven't been shown yet)
   - A notification indicator appears showing the number of missed questions

4. **Question Processing Steps**
   - Questions are assigned timestamps based on transcript segments
   - Timestamps are distributed throughout the video duration
   - Questions are processed in chronological order regardless of skip behavior

## Potential Issues Identified

1. **Sequential Question Display**:
   - When skipping past multiple question timestamps, questions are shown one at a time in chronological order
   - This is the intended behavior, but it might not be what users expect when skipping far ahead

2. **Frequency of Time Checks**:
   - The frequency of time checks (currently every render/state change) affects how quickly questions appear after reaching their timestamp
   - If questions don't appear immediately, it could be due to the check not running at that exact moment

3. **Video Player Integration**:
   - The communication between the VideoQuiz component and the video player is critical
   - Questions only appear if the VideoQuiz component receives the current time updates from the player

## Test Results

We simulated two scenarios:

1. **Normal Playback**: Questions appeared exactly at their timestamps, paused the video, and continued after answering
2. **Skipping Video**: When skipping past multiple timestamps, all questions were correctly identified and shown in sequence

Both scenarios validated that the question mechanism works correctly with the enhanced debugging output.

## Debug Tools Added

1. **Periodic State Logging**:
   - Component periodically logs its complete state every 5 seconds
   - This helps track the component's behavior over time

2. **Timestamp Assignment Debugging**:
   - Detailed logs when assigning timestamps to questions
   - Shows the distribution of questions throughout the video

3. **Eligibility Check Debugging**:
   - Each question is evaluated with detailed logging about why it is eligible or not
   - Shows time checks, answered status, and processed status

4. **Question Display Events**:
   - Logs when questions are shown, including their ID and timestamp
   - Logs when the video is paused/resumed for questions

## Conclusion

The VideoQuiz component appears to be working as designed. Questions are correctly identified and shown when their timestamps are reached, both during normal playback and when skipping. 

The most likely reason for users not seeing questions when skipping could be:

1. The questions might be appearing but users might expect a different behavior (e.g., showing all missed questions at once)
2. The user might be skipping very quickly, not giving the component enough time to process the change
3. There might be issues with how the video player communicates the current time to the VideoQuiz component

We recommend using the enhanced debugging output to observe the component's behavior in real-world usage scenarios, particularly focusing on the logs when skipping through the video.
